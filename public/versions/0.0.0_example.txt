New version file name should be formated as such:

x.x.x_title_of_version.txt

Where x.x.x is the version number <major>.<minor>.<patch>
and the title of the version should be added after the version number
with underscores seperating each word

Within the file each line will represent a change in the changelog
Add a + before the line if it is a major change
Add a - before the line if it is a minor change

Example:
+ ui change for the farm page
+ liquidity section of swap page added
- css edits to make it more mobile compatible
- change some language on the swap page
- added an extra category in the monitor page
